# Mac Remote

Online backup services are great, but they can bring your Internets to a crawl while uploading.

So I created `mac-remote` to easily pause and resume [Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com) and [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/) cloud backup services from any phone via WiFi.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:wmluke/mac-remote.git
$ cd mac-remote
$ node app
```

## Don't get hacked!!!

Safety first! Only run this app when you're connected to a TRUSTED network!
